  <p class="body">Peter Cheng is Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex, in the Department of Informatics.  Following his PhD in AI, he held a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, where he collaborated with Herbert Simon on computational models of diagrams in scientific discovery.  Since then his research has focussed on the cognitive science of representational systems.  This includes the study of how diagrammatic representations can dramatically improve learning in conceptually challenging topics and how knowledge-based graphical user interfaces can produce sophisticated expert-like performance from novices with minimal training.  The key to this research his design and evaluation of novel representations for diverse conceptually demanding educational domains (e.g., circuit electricity, particle collisions, logic, probability) and information intensive problem solving (e.g., scheduling, production planning, recipe design).  Generalising over new designs has allows cognitive and epistemic principles of representational systems to be found and tested.  Peter has published widely in leading outlets spanning cognitive science, human computer-interaction, visualisation, psychology, and science education.  </p>
